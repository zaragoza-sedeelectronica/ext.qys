                    <p>The CLARITY project is a two-year project funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 framework, that brings together stakeholder networks across Europe into an engaged and mobilised community that supports innovation in open eGovernment applications. The project aims to support European Member states in their pursuit for greater trust, transparency and efficiency within government via the increased uptake of open eGovernment initiatives.</p>

                    <p>Awareness of user expectations when dealing with the public sector through eGovernment services may facilitate the interaction between public administrations and users. Open eGovernment services should be developed around how users can, want, or need to use those services, rather than forcing people to use a service that does not meet their expectations. <a href="/sede/portal/clarity/recommendations#usercentered"><span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span> Read more</a>

                    <p>Personalisation is a way to improve user satisfaction by tailoring a service to specific individuals or segments of individuals’ needs. Open eGovernment services should be customisable and adapt to the user or group of users’ profile.

                    <p>Universal accessibility is a fundamental requirement for the success of any open eGovernment. In contrast to the private sector, which can be excluding by reaching only target market segments, public administrations should design open eGovernment services that are inclusive by default and cater to the needs of everyone. However, accessibility options are often few and ill-locatable on open eGovernment services. <a href="/sede/portal/clarity/recommendations#universal"><span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span> Read more</a> <span class="label label-success pull-right margin-t1em">More personalised public services</span>
