<!--/*<p>The findings of this report, as well as the feedback of an evaluation workshop and a consultation process, where different stakeholders will be asked for their opinions and suggestions, will guide the preparation of a definite blueprint, which will be the main component of deliverable D4.2. This last version of the blueprint will provide a timeline of a list of recommendations for civil servants and policy makers at national and EU level. It will take the form of an action plan based on their interdependencies and a roadmap of R+D initiatives alongside it, necessary to accelerate their development.</p>*/-->
